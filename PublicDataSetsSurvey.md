## 4. Predictive maintenance 

**From NASA:**

Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set:
- Description: Engine degradation simulation was carried out using C-MAPSS. Four different were sets simulated under different combinations of operational conditions and fault modes. Records several sensor channels to characterize fault evolution. The data set was provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames. 
- Link: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan 
Comments: this data set seems to be popular for research about predictive maintenance.


Li-ion Battery Aging Datasets:
- Description: This data set has been collected from a custom built battery prognostics testbed at the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE). Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) at different temperatures. Discharges were carried out at different current load levels until the battery voltage fell to preset voltage thresholds. Some of these thresholds were lower than that recommended by the OEM (2.7 V) in order to induce deep discharge aging effects. Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries.
