<p>could you conduct some research on publicly available machine learning datasets? Im am particularly interested in datasets from our use cases perspective, so the following would be really nice (the more, the better).</p>
<ol>
<li>Forecasting Datasets (data with a temporal component, ideally with additional features and not simply the time series).</li>
<li>Predictive maintenance datasets (data from producing machines etc.).</li>
<li>Text mining / text classification datasets, potentially with OCR-relevant data</li>
<li>Any nice supervised learning datasets (potentially ordered by size – I am not the greatest fan of the typical Titanic/Iris/etc. datasets).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="forecasting-data-sets">Forecasting Data Sets</h2>
<p>The data sets in this last are collected in a way that not only the temporal feature is included but also additional features concerned with the problem under examination.</p>
<p><strong>From Kaggle:</strong><br>
10 most voted data sets (in decreasing order):</p>
<ol>
<li>S&amp;P 500 stock data: Historical stock data for for all companies currently found on the S&amp;P 500 index.<br>
Goal:</li>
<li>Bitcoin Blockchain: Complete live historical Bitcoin blockchain (blocks and transactions)</li>
<li>Historical Hourly Weather Data 2012-2017: Hourly weather data for 30 US cities, Canadian Cities, and 6 Israeli Cities. Various weather attributes, such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, etc. are included.</li>
<li>Energy consumption of the Netherlands: electricity and Gas consumed in the Netherlands every year different pollution levels in Madrid from 2001 to 2018.</li>
<li>DJIA 30 Stock Time Series Historical stock data for 30 DIJA companies (2006-01-01 to 2018-01-01)</li>

<p><strong>From NASA:</strong></p>
<p>Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Description: Engine degradation simulation was carried out using C-MAPSS. Four different were sets simulated under different combinations of operational conditions and fault modes. Records several sensor channels to characterize fault evolution. The data set was provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames.</li>

Comments: this data set seems to be popular for research about predictive maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Li-ion Battery Aging Datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Description: This data set has been collected from a custom built battery prognostics testbed at the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE). Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) at different temperatures. Discharges were carried out at different current load levels until the battery voltage fell to preset voltage thresholds. Some of these thresholds were lower than that recommended by the OEM (2.7 V) in order to induce deep discharge aging effects. Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries.</li>

<p>AMLWorkshop</p>
<ul>
<li>Description: Data used in the Azure Machine Learning workshop delivered at Silicon Valley Microsoft Technology Center. The business problem for this example is about predicting problems caused by component failures such that the question “What is the probability that a machine will fail in the near future due to a failure of a certain component?” can be answered.</li>
<li>Comments: multi-classification problem.</li>
